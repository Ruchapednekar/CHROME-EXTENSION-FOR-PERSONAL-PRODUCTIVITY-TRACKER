The Personal Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension is a web-based tool developed to assist users in enhancing their daily productivity by tracking and visualizing their browsing habits. This extension allows users to set daily goals, monitor the amount of time spent on various websites, and analyze their productivity trends through interactive charts. The core objective of this project is to help individuals become more aware of their online activities and manage their time effectively by using a browser-based assistant.

The development of this project was carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which served as the primary code editor. Visual Studio Code is a powerful and lightweight source-code editor that supports a wide range of extensions and features, including real-time syntax highlighting, debugging tools, terminal integration, and version control support. These tools made the process of writing, testing, and maintaining the code more efficient and seamless.

The application is built using React.js, a widely-used JavaScript library that enables developers to construct dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture made it easier to divide the application into functional segments such as goal setting, time tracking, and chart visualization. These components include GoalSetter, TimeTracker, ProductivityChart, and WebsiteTracker, each handling a specific feature of the productivity tracker. React also provided the flexibility to update the user interface in real time based on changes in user activity.

The extension leverages Chrome Extension APIs, such as chrome.tabs and chrome.idle, to gather real-time data about the websites the user visits. The time spent on each website is calculated and stored using chrome.storage.local, allowing the data to persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed. This real-time monitoring enables the application to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the user's browsing patterns.

For data visualization, the extension uses Chart.js, a JavaScript charting library, integrated through the react-chartjs-2 wrapper. This allowed for the creation of clear, informative charts that display website usage statistics, helping users quickly understand their browsing behaviors. By interpreting these visual trends, users can make informed decisions about their digital habits.

This productivity tracker extension is particularly useful for individuals who want to improve their time management. Students can use it to ensure they are spending sufficient time on educational websites while minimizing distractions. Professionals working remotely or independently can analyze their time distribution to maintain focus and productivity during work hours. Even casual users aiming to reduce unnecessary screen time can benefit from the insights provided by this extension.

Overall, this project showcases practical skills in React development, browser API integration, and UI/UX design, all aimed at solving a real-world problem. It not only highlights technical proficiency but also demonstrates how technology can be used to promote mindful and responsible digital behavior. This tool serves as a smart companion for anyone looking to optimize their daily online activities and develop healthier productivity habits.
